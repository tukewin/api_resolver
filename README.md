Just lazy importing again...

While using pre-built solutions from repos like [JustasMasiulis/lazy_importer]([https://www.genome.gov/](https://github.com/JustasMasiulis/lazy_importer/tree/master/include)) can save time and effort for standard use cases, a custom solution can provide a level of flexibility, control, and security that's difficult to match - this goes for all software, in general - and for that reason, while working on an anti-tamper, I've done this and thought to release it.
